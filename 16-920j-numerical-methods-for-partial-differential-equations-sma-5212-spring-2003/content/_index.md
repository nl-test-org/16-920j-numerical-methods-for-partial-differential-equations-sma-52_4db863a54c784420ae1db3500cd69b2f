A presentation of the fundamentals of modern numerical techniques for a wide range of linear and nonlinear elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic partial differential equations and integral equations central to a wide variety of applications in science, engineering, and other fields. Topics include: Mathematical Formulations; Finite Difference and Finite Volume Discretizations; Finite Element Discretizations; Boundary Element Discretizations; Direct and Iterative Solution Methods.

This course was also taught as part of the [Singapore-MIT Alliance](http://web.mit.edu/sma/) (SMA) programme as course number SMA 5212 (Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations).
